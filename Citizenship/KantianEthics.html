  	    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kantian ethics hold that moral rules are absolute and apply everywhere, irrespective 
  	    	of circumstances or context.  It contends that rational people are duty-bound by the 
  	    	Categorical Imperative ("Everyone should/ought to do X") and avoids consideration of 
  	    	consequences for actions by strict adherence to moral rules that are universally true. 
  	    	It asserts that we cannot know the consequences or outcomes of our actions, only that 
  	    	the rules are universally valid and applicable. Thus, it fails in situations where the 
  	    	consequences of obeying absolute rules may actually cause harm (e.g. in the case of the 
  	    	Inquiring Murderer), or in dilemmas between opposing absolute moral rules.<br><br>

	        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compassionate Critical Thinking appreciates the idea of human rights and dignity as  well as the 
	        spirit of consistent, unambiguous rules put forward by Kantian Ethics, but it also recognizes that 
	        Life is complicated and the proper course of action often depends on the situational context in 
	        which it arises.  Furthermore, it does not presume that Moral Laws can be discovered through a 
	        priori deduction alone.  Even if this were true, how could such laws be demonstrated to be 
	        "universally valid" or "known to be True?"  What test could be applied to such rules to validate them?  
	        Compassionate Critical Thinking does not assume that such questions can be answered definitively, 
	        but it does value the questions themselves as well as attempts to answer them.<br><br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another distinction between Kantian Ethics and Compassionate Critical Thinking relates to punishment.  
          CCT emphasizes rehabilitation and forgiveness over retribution.  It recognizes that everyone is different, 
          humans are imperfect, and that distinctions between "good" and "bad" aren't necessarily absolute or binary; 
          instead it allows for a continuum of compliance according to "best practices" where some may be "farther along" 
          because they have more experience receiving and recognizing the benefits of a cooperative society (in accord 
          with Social Contract Theory).  Compassionate Critical Thinking recognizes that humans are innately different 
          from one another, thus some people have had greater privilege to receive the benefits of "lawful morality" that 
          others have not yet experienced.<br><br>
          
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A suburbanite in a safe school most certainly has had different life experiences and benefits than an urbanite 
          in an unsafe school.  Thus, Compassionate Critical Thinking attempts to recognize this distinction and improve 
          upon this imbalance rather than punish people regardless of any considerations about their personal background.  
          The ideal case is to promote less variation in quality of life for everyone (i.e. the "best off" in society are 
          not so far removed from the "worst off" in society).  And the goal of society according to CCT is to lift everyone 
          up from below (as a "rising tide that lifts all boats") -- not "forced equality" but mitigated inequality.
